# 2019-OpenViduSurveillance

## Phase 1 - Experimental / exploratory phase

In this project we are going to develop a web app in order to manage and connect IP cameras using the RTSP and ONVIF protocols.
In this first stage, we will focus on experimenting with a camera, try to connect it using some simple web app and make use of the ONVIF protocol to move the camera.
