# 2019-OpenViduSurveillance

## Phase 1 - Experimental / exploratory phase

In this project we are going to develop a web app in order to manage and connect IP cameras using the RTSP and ONVIF protocols.
In this first stage, we will focus on experimenting with a camera, try to connect it using some simple web app and make use of the ONVIF protocol to move the camera.

## Phase 2 - Divide in Frontend and Backend

Once the app is functional, its time to implement correctly a frontend and a backend. For the frontend we'll use Angular and for the backend we'll use Spring Boot. Additionally to this, the backend will have a MySQL database to store data for the different sessions and cameras.
Both of them will have a separate README inside this project.
